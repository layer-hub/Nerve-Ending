# tinyfig

`tinyfig` is a lightweight JavaScript micro-library that provides a set of functions for creating and manipulating DOM elements declaratively. It is particularly suitable for building cross-framework UI components and feature enhancement libraries outside the business development of modern web frameworks (such as React, Vue, Svelte, and Alpine), which can significantly improve code readability and maintainability.
